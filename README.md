## Coding test

­- Try to avoid using third­party modules
­- Stick to node.js core APIs
­- Write a test to confirm your module works correctly

Create a duplex stream that outputs summary objects with keys for the
elapsed time, total length in bytes, and total lines.

Create a stream that takes the summary objects and outputs
a one­line summary report suitable for logging. The report should
include the throughput rate of the input stream in bytes/sec.

Use your new streams in a script designed to take text input (such as  
from a log file) and report on the number of lines and growth rate of
the file. Bonus points if your script is configurable in some way
via `argv` (use your imagination).

Imagine a usage like this:

```
$ tail -­f mylogfile | myscript ­­--verbose
```
